ABRAXASv2.1.0:

Instant startup, lazy curl init, boot race fix.

STARTUP:
- Gamma applied immediately after backend init, before curl/SSL/weather
- Deferred curl_global_init() to after gamma_set() in daemon, before event loop
- Removed curl_global_init() from main() -- commands that don't need network
  (--status, --set, --resume, --reset, --set-location) no longer pay SSL init cost
- Daemon retry loop: 500ms * 60 attempts for display server readiness at boot

BOOT RACE FIX:
- systemd user services start with default.target, minutes before X11 is ready
- graphical-session.target never activates on standalone WMs (awesome, i3, etc.)
- Fix: launch daemon from WM config where display server is guaranteed ready
- Retain systemd service file as fallback for DEs that activate graphical-session.target
- Service file: added Environment=DISPLAY=:0 for X11 backend access

DAEMON FIXES:
- Stale override cleanup: expired --set overrides are cleared on restart instead
  of replaying completed sigmoid transitions
- exit(1) on fatal gamma failure (was exit(0), preventing Restart=on-failure)
- install.py: stop service before binary copy (fixes ETXTBSY on running daemon)

README:
- Autostart section: WM-based launch as primary, systemd as DE fallback
- Documented instant startup (gamma before curl/SSL init)
- Removed systemctl enable from default install path

Files Changed:
- src/daemon.c (instant startup, lazy curl init, retry loop, stale override cleanup)
- src/main.c (removed curl_global_init from main, lazy init per-command)
- install.py (stop service before binary copy)
- abraxas.service (added Environment=DISPLAY=:0)
- README.md (autostart docs, instant startup)
